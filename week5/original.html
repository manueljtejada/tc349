	<h1>Final Project: Card Sorting</h1>
		
	<article>		
		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>For my final project, I have decided to do a website for my mom's business. It's a catering business called <em>Agüecoco</em>, which is a very dominican way of saying "coconut water." They have a very clean and simple branding image, so it will be very interesting to design and develop their webpage. The main pages I plan to do are: home, "about us", services, photos, recipes and "contact us".</p>
			
			<h4>More About the Company</h4>
			<p>Agüecoco is a company created in order to meet all the needs in the gastronomic and logistic areas of cultural and social events.</p>

<p>In Agüecoco we sustain the conception of Gastronomy of seeing the feeding of human framed within their environment and as a result of a shared history. Cooking for us goes beyond a simple job, it's a work of art, passion and science.</p>

		<h2>Card Sorting</h2>
			<p>The overall structure of the page turned out very simple. I discussed it with my mom and her business partner, and we agreed on the six main pages the website should have: home, "about us", services, photos, recipes and "contact us".</p>
			<p>After that, I created the other content cards and sorted them how I thought best. Over Facetime, I asked my mom and her partner to sort them how she though worked better, and amazingly it was the same structure I had thought of.</p>
